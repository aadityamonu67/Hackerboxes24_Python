Description
-----------------
This project is the implementation for Hackerboxes #24 using OpenCV and Python instead of Processing.   I had too much pain trying to get all the right versions of OpenCV, Java, Processing, etc. to work and realized that it was only a few python modules that cleanly installed on my Windows System.


Installation and Setup
-------------------------
Use the installation instructions found here:

http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

I recommend installing Python 2.7 first, then just using pip to install numpy and matplotlib.

You also will need to install pySerial, also via pip.

Once you have Python/OpenCV installed you can then upload the ino file to the arduino and run the code as is.   This was my first pass at this so I don't expect it to be perfect but it works pretty well for me.  I put a ton of comments in the code so hopefully you can understand how it works.
